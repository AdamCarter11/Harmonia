  - "Oh! You\u2019re awake!"
  - "You know I wasn\u2019t sure it was going to work\u2026 but look at you! How
    are you feeling?"
  - "First let me introduce myself. I am the Spirit of Music, guardian of all musical
    creations. For all of human history, I have enchanted individuals with the ability
    to create the most beautiful music of their time. I have watched it evolve from
    simple melodies to complex symphonies, and through all that, there has been peace\u2026
    until now. "
  - 'Well, I used to have a partner, the Soul of Music. Together we worked to maintain
    musical harmony against the forces of dissonance, but in our recent battle, they
    became corrupted. '
  - "Staring into their eyes\u2026 it was like they didn\u2019t even recognize me.
    Before I could stop them, they broke the boundary between this realm and Earth.
    This created a chain of chaos, trapping musicians in the realm of dissonance
    and replacing them with corrupted clones. So this is why I created you! "
  - "I\u2019ve given you the ability to retrieve their souls from the realm of dissonance,
    giving you all of the talents they possess. In order to do that, however, you
    must defeat their corrupted clones in a music battle. "
  - Once you have collected enough souls, you will be able to battle the Soul of
    Music. If you defeat them, you will free not just them but all musicians across
    time.
  - "Unfortunately, I am restricted from directly interacting with anything from
    Earth\u2026 I can only influence it from my realm. But don\u2019t worry, I will
    be able to guide you whenever you need it."
  - Here, let me take you to your first destination. Good Luck!
