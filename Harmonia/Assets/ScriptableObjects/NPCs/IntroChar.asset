  - "Oh! You\u2019re awake!"
  - "You know I wasn\u2019t sure it was going to work\u2026 but look at you! How
    are you feeling?"
  - First let me introduce myself. I am the Spirit of Music, guardian of all musical
    creations.
  - 'For all of human history, I have enchanted individuals with the ability to create
    the most beautiful music of their time. '
  - I have watched it evolve from simple melodies to complex symphonies
  - "and through all that, there has been peace\u2026 until now."
  - 'Well, I used to have a partner, the Soul of Music. '
  - Together we worked to maintain musical harmony against the forces of dissonance,
  - but in our recent battle, they became corrupted.
  - "Staring into their eyes\u2026 it was like they didn\u2019t even recognize me."
  - 'Before I could stop them, they broke the boundary between this realm and Earth. '
  - 'This created a chain of chaos, trapping musicians in the realm of dissonance '
  - and replacing them with corrupted clones. So this is why I created you!
  - "I\u2019ve given you the ability to retrieve their souls from the realm of dissonance,
    giving you all of the talents they possess."
  - In order to do that, however, you must defeat their corrupted clones in a music
    battle.
  - Once you have collected enough souls, you will be able to battle the Soul of
    Music.
  - If you defeat them, you will free not just them but all musicians across time.
  - "Unfortunately, I am restricted from directly interacting with anything from
    Earth\u2026 "
  - 'I can only influence it from my realm. '
  - "But don\u2019t worry, I will be able to guide you whenever you need it."
  - Here, let me take you to your first destination. Good Luck!
